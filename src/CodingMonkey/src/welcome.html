                <p>
                    Solving small problems allows you to focus on the fundamental parts of the C# language.
                    These fundamentals are what all larger problems are made up of. So this will improve your
                    ability to solve larger problems. To help with this all exercises on the site are split
                    into categories with a specific focus.

                <h2>Immediate Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting feedback as you do something is a great way to learn. It allows you to correct your
                    mistakes quickly while giving you a strong indication of your progress through an exercise.
                    Coding Monkey has tests which run against every attempt you submit. So you know when the
                    exercise has been completed.
